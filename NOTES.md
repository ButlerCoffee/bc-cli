When users subscribe we need first to know a few things:

1. Ground or Whole bean
2. Brewing type - choose only one between drip machine, french press, pour over, espresso, aeropress, cold brew, I don't know.
3. Size of bags 250gr, 500gr or 1kg
4. How many bags of coffee
5. Ask for any specific instructions with examples (I want half bags for espresso and the other half for cold brew), I am dying for a good decaf! give me only decaf!!!, and things like that.
6. Save all these into the backend and forward user to payment link
